Restored 1903 Craftsman, Garage and Large Back Yard

The best of both worlds - city living in a beautifully restored Central District house.  Gardens, a large yard, a full basement and even a garage.

All the amenities you could ask for, including:
• Original Fir Floors
• Gas Range 
• Brand new oversized LG washer and dryer
• Granite countertops
• Stainless appliances
• Microwave oven
• Dishwasher

Walk a block to the Neighbor Lady for a drink, Cortona for a coffee and waffle, or even the newly opened pot shop, Uncle Ike’s.

Capitol Hill is 10 blocks West (Zoe, Cafe Presse, Tavern Law), Madrona 10 blocks East (Red Cow, Bottle House, Molly Moon’s).  Other interesting areas are sprinkled around — the stretch of shops on 15th, on 19th, various Ethiopian restaurants and Ezell’s Chicken
